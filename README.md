## 🧠 Project Overview
Phishing is a social engineering attack where attackers impersonate trusted entities to steal sensitive information.  
In this task, a **controlled phishing attack simulation** was performed to understand how phishing emails are created, how users interact with them, and how such attacks can be detected and prevented.

⚠️ *This activity was conducted strictly for educational and awareness purposes.*

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand phishing and social engineering attacks  
- Simulate a phishing attack in a safe environment  
- Identify phishing indicators and red flags  
- Analyze user behavior during phishing attempts  
- Learn effective phishing prevention techniques

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|--------|
| GoPhish | Phishing simulation framework |
| Email Templates | Crafting phishing emails |
| Landing Page | Simulated fake login page |

---

## 🔄 Methodology
1. Studied common phishing attack techniques  
2. Created a fake IT-support phishing email  
3. Designed a fake login landing page  
4. Simulated phishing email delivery  
5. Observed user interaction behavior  
6. Identified phishing indicators  
7. Documented findings and prevention methods

## 📸 Screenshots
The following screenshots are included in the `Screenshots/` folder:
- Phishing email template  
- Fake login landing page  

These screenshots are also referenced in the final report.

## 🔍 Key Findings
- Urgent language increases click probability  
- Users often ignore sender verification  
- URL mismatch is a major phishing indicator  
- Lack of awareness leads to higher risk  

---

## 🛡 Prevention Techniques
- Security awareness training  
- Email filtering and spam detection  
- URL inspection before clicking  
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)  

---

## 📄 Deliverables
- 📘 Detailed Phishing Simulation Report (PDF)  
- 📸 Screenshots of phishing setup

## ✅ Conclusion
This task demonstrates that phishing attacks rely heavily on human psychology rather than technical vulnerabilities. Continuous awareness training is essential to reduce phishing-related risks.
